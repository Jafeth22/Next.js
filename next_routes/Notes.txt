File-Based-Routing
	Routing works with files and not on the Route Paths as in React

API folder

Nested routes
    When you create a file or folder, the NextJs Framework recognizes it as a route

Dynamic routes
    To create a dynamic route file, we should to add [] to the name, like this: [id].js

SSG (getStaticProps)
    Statically generate the pages and pre-render the content onto that page and we won't see
    any loading icon on the web
